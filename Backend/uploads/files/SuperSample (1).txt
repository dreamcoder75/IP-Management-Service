=================Full Stack / AWS / CI&CD============================

Hello, Thanks for your job posting. 

I'm a full-stack developer who has much experience in Javascript/Typescript, AWS, Terraform, Java and Python.
I'm very familiar with JavaScript/Typescript, Java, GraphQL, Git, ASP.NET, Docker, RESTful API, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS services. Also, I'm enough experience with Mobile Web App Development and I've developed many sites and apps for 3 years.

I had been creating, hosting, designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining some cloud services on AWS by using Amplify, EC2, lambda, Cognito, API Gateway, Cloud Front, AppSync, and DynamoDB, and been deep diving into DevOps practices and principles, and have rich experience in managing scalable infrastructure on Amazon Web Services, Linux, Docker, Serverless.

Recently, I worked on very similar project. I took part in the development of LMS(Learning Management System) and I implemented the frontend pixel perfectly using ReactJS/AntDesign(Typescript) according to the Figma design. Also, I implemented the backend API using NodeJS and the CI/CD using AWS services and then automate all steps using Terraform. 
I worked as a full-stack and DevOps engineer.

Please take a look at this website.
app.fl4k.com
Kids can learn the Spanish languages through this system.
There are some types of users( Admin, Teacher, Student). Also there are various curriculums including questions and answers(Image, Text, Audio...).

Configured the infrastructure like this.
- Frontend: React, Backend Node. Database: MySQL
- Use docker: Npm, Node, php, MySQL container,
- GH Action: Detect changes and trigger the CodePipeline.
- Most used AWS services for CI/CD: EC2, CodePipeline, S3 bucket, RDS(PostgreSQL), SQS, ECR, Cloud Watch...
	● Deployed the server on EC2: Nginx server configuration
	● CodePipeline (Source step: GH, Build Step: CodeBuild, Deploy Step: CodeDeploy)
		The source step detects/outputs the changes and triggers the CodeBuild. CodeDeploy receives the output of the CodeBuild step and deploys the result to EC2.
	● ECR for external cache: This improves the Build Step to reduce the time.
	● Connect the CloudWatch service for deployment monitoring 
	● Global accelerator for load balancing
- Automate all steps for CI/CD were automated using Terraform, I can configure CI/CD easily by using terraform CLI.
If you want, I can show and explain some parts of projects by running projects in my local.

Hope my experience will be helpful for your project. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Look forward to discussing more detail about this opportunity.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

=====================================Python Django + React=====================================


Hello, Thanks for your job posting. 

I am a Professional Python Engineer who has 7+ years of experience in Python technology.
I am very specialized to working Data Analysis technology using libraries like TesorFlow, PyTorch and Apache Spark and Python Web Backend Development using Python Web frameworks like Django, Flask, FastAPI.

Especially, I am very good experience with Python Web development using Python Djang, Flask, RabbitMQ, Celery, Reddis and the other various kind of Python frameworks and libraries.
And also, I've worked the various DevOps development using Python and AWS and microservices.
I had been creating, hosting, designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining some cloud services on AWS by using Amplify, EC2, lambda, Cognito, API Gateway, Cloud Front, AppSync, and DynamoDB, and been deep diving into DevOps practices and principles, and have rich experience in managing scalable infrastructure on Amazon Web Services, Linux, Docker, Serverless.

Recently, I worked on very similar project. I took part in the development of LMS(Learning Management System) and I implemented the frontend pixel perfectly using ReactJS/AntDesign according to the Figma design. Also, I implemented the backend server and API using Python Django and FastAPI and the CI/CD using AWS services and then automate all steps using Terraform. 
I worked as a full-stack and DevOps engineer.

Please take a look at this website.
app.fl4k.com
Kids can learn the Spanish languages through this system.
There are some types of users( Admin, Teacher, Student). Also there are various curriculums including questions and answers(Image, Text, Audio...).

Configured the infrastructure like this.
- Frontend: React, Backend Python Django. Database: SQLite
- Use docker: Django, FastAPI, MySQL container,
- GH Action: Detect changes and trigger the CodePipeline.
- Most used AWS services for CI/CD: EC2, CodePipeline, S3 bucket, RDS(PostgreSQL), SQS, ECR, Cloud Watch...
	● Deployed the server on EC2: Nginx server configuration
	● CodePipeline (Source step: GH, Build Step: CodeBuild, Deploy Step: CodeDeploy)
		The source step detects/outputs the changes and triggers the CodeBuild. CodeDeploy receives the output of the CodeBuild step and deploys the result to EC2.
	● ECR for external cache: This improves the Build Step to reduce the time.
	● Connect the CloudWatch service for deployment monitoring 
	● Global accelerator for load balancing
- Automate all steps for CI/CD were automated using Terraform, I can configure CI/CD easily by using terraform CLI.
If you want, I can show and explain some parts of projects by running projects in my local.

Hope my experience will be helpful for your project. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Look forward to discussing more detail about this opportunity.

Thanks for your time and consideration.
Best Regard!

Hello, thanks for your job posting.
I have read your job description and I am really interested in this job opportunity
I have 8 years of Backend development experience and I am familiar with Python, Javascript, Php, Rust, Golang.
Backend development is now going to micro service architecture by using Kafka, RabbitMQ. Also the Docker containerization is used widely for scalability and fast development.
I can configure CI/CD by using Jenkins and github actions. I used web3js, Etherjs for blockchain event cache and backend signature system for blockchain signature(EIP712 Domain), log and catch events.
Here are apps I have developed so far.
